# Ceiling-Aided Autonomous Navigation (CAAN)

Ceiling-Aided Autonomous Navigation (CAAN) is a vision-based localization system that improves indoor robot navigation by utilizing ceiling markers.

This project was developed for a robotics competition and focuses on enhancing localization robustness in indoor environments where traditional SLAM may suffer from drift or occlusion.

## 📌 Overview

CAAN introduces a ceiling-based visual localization approach to support autonomous mobile robots.  
Instead of relying only on LiDAR or ground-level features, the system detects ceiling markers to:

- Improve pose estimation accuracy
- Reduce localization drift
- Maintain navigation stability in dynamic indoor environments
